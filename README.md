## 💻 Embedded Systems Expertise

I specialize in:

- **Embedded C Programming** for microcontrollers like **AVR** (ATmega32) and **PIC**
- Designing **COTS drivers** (GPIO, UART, SPI, Timers, PWM, ADC ,Interrupts) , [Here](https://github.com/OmarKhaled-00/AVR_COTS/tree/main/MCAL)
- Designed Hardware Abstraction Layers (HAL) for components such as Stepper Motor, Servo Motor, LCD, and others. 
- Real-time systems using **RTOS principles**

## 📁 Projects Highlights

- 🔐 **Access Control & Limitation System** (DC motors + IR sensors + elevator logic)
- 🚨 **Safety Monitoring & Alarm System** (flame, gas, temp, LDR + ESP8266 real-time alert)
- 📡 **Real-Time Communication System** (UART/SPI between ATmega32 + cloud sync)
- 🏥 **Hospital Reservation Software** (C-based with user/doctor/admin roles, fake app for intruder tracing)

All code and documentation are available in my [GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/OmarKhaledYounis?tab=repositories).

## 🌐 Transition into Full Stack Web Development

After gaining solid experience in **Embedded Systems** and **Hardware Development**, I’ve decided to expand my horizons by diving into the world of **Full Stack Web Development**.

This transition reflects my passion for building **complete, scalable, and interactive digital solutions** — from intuitive front-end user experiences to efficient back-end logic and database management.

### 🛠️ Currently Strengthening My Skills In:

- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React  
- **Back-End:** Node.js, Express  
- **Databases:** MongoDB, SQL  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

I'm committed to blending my embedded systems expertise with modern web technologies to develop impactful and integrated solutions.


To become a **professional Embedded Systems Engineer**, contribute to real-world solutions, and one day work in **Germany** 🇩🇪.
