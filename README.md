## 💻 Embedded Systems Expertise

I specialize in:

- **Embedded C Programming** for microcontrollers like **AVR** (ATmega32) and **PIC**
- Designing **COTS drivers** (GPIO, UART, SPI, Timers, PWM, ADC ,Interrupts) , [Here](https://github.com/OmarKhaled-00/AVR_COTS/tree/main/MCAL)
- Real-time systems using **RTOS principles**
- Communication protocols: **UART**, **SPI**, **I2C**
- Integration with **ESP8266 Wi-Fi module**

## 📁 Projects Highlights

- 🔐 **Access Control & Limitation System** (DC motors + IR sensors + elevator logic)
- 🚨 **Safety Monitoring & Alarm System** (flame, gas, temp, LDR + ESP8266 real-time alert)
- 📡 **Real-Time Communication System** (UART/SPI between ATmega32 + cloud sync)
- 🏥 **Hospital Reservation Software** (C-based with user/doctor/admin roles, fake app for intruder tracing)

All code and documentation are available in my [GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/OmarKhaledYounis?tab=repositories).
