## 🌐 Transition into Full Stack Web Development

After gaining solid experience in **Embedded Systems** and **Hardware Development**, I’ve decided to expand my horizons by diving into the world of **Full Stack Web Development**.

This transition reflects my passion for building **complete, scalable, and interactive digital solutions** — from intuitive front-end user experiences to efficient back-end logic and database management.

### 🛠️ Currently Strengthening My Skills In:

- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React  
- **Back-End:** Node.js, Express  
- **Databases:** MongoDB, SQL  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

I'm committed to blending my embedded systems expertise with modern web technologies to develop impactful and integrated solutions.


To become a **professional Embedded Systems Engineer**, contribute to real-world solutions, and one day work in **Germany** 🇩🇪.
